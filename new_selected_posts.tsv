I've been absent from them from a couple of years and have reconnected. I have gotten close to her family and have tried to talk to her and she refuses to talk to me and says there is nothing to talk about. I'm good friends with her brothers and close to their mom. I don't want to cause any trouble though in the family.	0

All of that are such tough things to deal-first with your friend's mother, and then when you really need someone to talk to and be there for you, you instead feel used by your boyfriend.  It makes sense that he's focused on sex-what guy isn't?- but you also have needs that need to be met in a relationship.  And I hope you can find the courage to open up to him about your emotional needs.  You deserve to find someone who can also be there for you emotionally.  In any case, I hope tomorrow is a better day for you.  And know that we're here for you!  Let us know how the doctor appointment goes- we're rooting for you	0

I visited my friend's mother in the hospital, she had a stroke about a month ago, it was hard seeing her like that, but I'm proud of her at the same time because she walked a little bit today. I was down a little bit after seeing her though, because I hadn't seen her since before she had the stroke. I come home and get online after my boyfriend had texted me that he missed me. When I got home all he wanted was cybersex. I'm already depressed and tired but I didn't say no because I'm afraid it'll start a fight. Finally, tomorrow I'm going to the doctor to get my blood checked out because I think my abilify is causing high blood sugar. Wish me luck.	0

Stay very active in your childrens lives and stay in the home.  Hate to say, my wife moved out because she had some issues with me, yet always told me and everyone else what an awesome husband I am.  The issues I feel didn't warrant her leaving.  She had issues with working to much, a traumatic event that happened before our marriage (16 years later, can happen).  I was trying to change for her and support her more.  Couples therapy and individual therapy.  She started drinking heavily.  I took her to the hospital, where I discovered she had been cheating on me.  Stay sane.  Talk to those you can trust.  Take care.	0

I'm a first time mom so I'm very concern about my child's wellbeing in all aspects of life. My 4 month old has had cough for the last month & just recently it got worse, I got concerned when she started to breath more heavily & was having a hard time catching her breathe, the medications she was given mentioned that if there was any difficulty in breathing to stop taking the medication & see the doctor immediately. Well it was the weekend & the doctor office was closed. I told my husband that I wanted to go to the emergency room but he was like the baby looks fine & it's not like the baby is in a life or death situation. That pissed me off , if had bother to look at the medication then he would know that difficulty breathing was a sign to seek medical attention. Anyways we ended up going to the ER,& spent most of our day there. She was checked out & given some other medications to help with her breathing. During our time there the nurses & doctors said that it was the right thing to do to come to the ER. Which goes to prove that I was right about being concerned & the ER was the right thing to do.  Pissed me off about this whole thing even more was when my husband said it was ""not a life or death situation"" he also added that it was pointless for us to go in & take the resources away from someone that needed the ER.    Omg.. What the heck. I wanted to punch his  face. To add more to how much I am hating him right now , I notice that my baby had an abnormal crease on one of her legs . I did some googling and found out that it could be a symptom of hip dysphasia . I told my so-called husband that & instead of talking about it , he gets all angry & says I'm paranoid. I want to slap him . He says that telling him this stresses him out & that I should bring it up with the do doctor when I see him in the next 2 days.  Grrrrrr... The baby's health is priority & the fact that he put himself first by saying it stresses him out , pisses me off. It's ok when he tells me he's worried that he thinks he has this illness or that illness but when I bring up our kid's health concern it's like ""omg I can't deal with it , it stresses me out. Holy f***! I have to deal with his concern over his own health & our kid's health , I'm more stress then he is but do you see me telling him "" no, I don't want other about your concerns over your health cause it stresses me out?"" *f*** no.. I listen . He thought he had Parkinson's at one point  because he said he had some of the symptoms -whose paranoid now? So it's ok for him to be paranoid about his own health but it's not ok for me to be when it comes to OUR kid?? What a selfish pig I'm so pissed right now , I dont know if I will be able to sleep"	0

I understand, my father was abusive for a while too, he used to make me puke up my food and i wasnt allowed to eat anything with sugar and he hit me all the time.    Don't end your life, i know it sucks right now and all you feel is dissapointment and you feel like you let everyone down and its your fault but honey its not.  Shes not doing this because your a good for nothing daughter, im sure your a trying so hard; she doing this because there is something personal on the inside that she is dealing with.  There is something not right with her mind that she is not happy with and im sorry that shes reflecting that back on how she treats you.  It may seem like a long time but there will be a time where you can finally be on your own, free to do what you want and you will find someone and/or something that makes you so happy and you will realize how worth it it was to choose to live.  in the end the choice is up to you but baby girl i hope you choose to live because in the end it will get better even though it seems far away. its not your fault, it hasnt been your fault.  It's not your fault if your mother physically hurts you, thats her choice, thats her makeing the action, it just matters what you make out of it.  Be strong honey.	0
921	261507	1209437	1209437	reply_to_discussion	Likeduhxbella	1429111532	That is not true. Your not a good for nothing daughter. I've been told that. My dad and I had a horrible relationship when I was younger, I'm 26 now. But it's only now that I'm older he explain to me since I'm better than I was, is that he was raised in an abusive home and got beat if you opened the refrigerator door after dinner, or if you fell down off your bike you would get yelled at and told to stop crying and get back up. And my father use to slap me and pull my hair and catch my ponytail as I would walk off when he was yelling at me. But he also told me he never understood depression, back then no one had thst or was treated for it. It was an excuse not to go to school. And he also told me that he would get so angry and upset to see me that way but that's how his affection came out because he never got love and affection when he was younger back in the 50s. So I understand better now why, I just thought my dad hated me and hated that I was alive. I got called a wh*re, good for nothing peice of you know what, and the b word, anything and everything. But he had his own childhood issues. It's not exactly fair but try talk in a way where both of you can understand eachother.  don't think it's you because it's not and as you get older you'll see how the relationship changes. No need to end your life at all. Hang in there. Things get better. Hope this helps xo	0

Hypothetically if a year down the line she told me she didn't feel she was getting attention from me (assuming she wasn't sexting another man), i would fully understand and know how to fix it. What I struggle with is why each time she was messaging him (which is 400 plus messages) why didn't she stop and think. So for her now to tell me she felt I wasn't  giving her attention just feels like something she has made up to make her feel better. And telling me she loves and respects me is just bull.	0

Sometimes in life we do for others or animals things that we wouldn't necessarily do for ourselves. I am very grateful for them now. I do go on long walks but if I get too far away from my car I do get uneasy. You have to remember that I developed agoraphobia about 5 years ago.

Just for anyone that reads this, if walking a dog while pushing a stroller don't attach the leash to the stroller or wrap the leash around your hand or arm. If the dog pulls, you could be upsetting the stroller and an injury may occur.	0

Do you have court related documents that say when you can and can't visit/see her?   Is this all temporarily? Also, have you told your doctor you don't feel the medicine is helping you?  Sometimes medicine with other life changes help people feel better like good self-care, healthy foods, exercise, etc	0

1002	364276	1736945	1736945	reply_to_discussion	Michellesteem	1457877863	Hi. I understand what it's like, taking the first step to talk to someone new. I'm no social butterfly and sometimes, I'm just so envious of those people who fit in so well. I tend to stick to a corner and hope that no one would notice me. But then one day I decided, I want to change. As they say, the first step is always the hardest. I made small changes here and there, first smiling a lot. You can never go wrong with smiling. And then I started to say small hellos to random strangers. It felt weird at first but I learnt that hey, it isn't so bad. I could be making someone's day by giving them a big smile. And you never know, sometimes, smiling encourages other people to come and talk to you instead so you don't have to go to them. I know it's hard at first because it was hard for me as well. My palms get sweaty, my heart beats faster and I just want to vomit. But they say practice makes perfect. I'm better at talking to people now. Of course, there are times when I still get anxious but I find ways to cope. And I really admire you for taking the first step to post this! Feel free to talk to me because I would love to talk and try to help in any way I can. Also, drinking and smoking is not the best way to cope. There are other better ways to cope. Have a nice day!	0

My life is really crappy and yes I know, others have it worse but that does not mean that I am not hurting at the moment. People don't see what I see because they aren't living my life so they are always quick to assume that I am a spoiled little brat who can't deal with obstacles.

It seems that life has a lot of extremes to it and I didn't understand this.  If I did things a certain way, I thought I would deserve or be given happiness.

I was in a really bad state yesterday.  Crying, thinking negative thoughts, planning out what I was going to say in my goodbye letters, those sort of things.  Not the first time that I have been there but it has been awhile thanks to therapy and meds.  Today seems like a regular, normal day.  No crying spells.  No negative thoughts.

1043	87243			start_discussion	mdchel	1352348186	Four years ago I suffered with severe agoraphobia and panic disorder.  I would hardly leave my own bedroom at times.  This was a acute onset from a traumatic experience and was so different than how I usually live my life that I had major depression as well.  After much therapy and help, I was able to reenter the world and work.  I was able to travel and start to feel myself again. Unfortunately, that did not last too long.  Earlier this year I started having the anxiety, panic and agoraphobia again.  I immediately expressed this to my therapist and prescriber so we tried some new medications and treatments in an attempt to keep it away.	0

1045	97218			start_discussion	seppie83	1364576371	My name is September Helmeke and recently I had placed a call to 911 for my fiance who was trying to commit suicide and they brought him to the 212 building in Chaska were I don't feel he was properly evaluated and have now had him sitting in the Carver county jail on 10,000 bail since last week the judge had ordered his DBT therapy and the jail has now cancelled all his DBT appointment, they won't allow him contact with me or my children because they are trying to charge him with domestic assult and I am his Power of Attorny but I can't be in contact with him to make any arrangements regarding lawyers or anything. My Fiance suffers from Borderline Personality Disorder along with a list of other disorders and when this incident took place he was not properly medicated due to neglect by his psychiatrist and the prosecutors refuse to look at his mental health and well being. They refuse to acknowledge the concern of me or his parents and are mentally distroying him more. I have voiced my concerns to everyone I possible could and nobody is listening to me or his parents so I am hoping maybe to reach out and receive a little help from you on this issue if not I will just keep climbing the chain until something is done. It seems to me and everyone else like your prosecution is punishing him for being mentally ill and not doing what they should be doing. They are not coming forward with any plea deals or anything and right now my concern is my fiance's mental well being.	0
