I was listening to Annie Kaszina on youtube to day and she, being British, and abused herself has a good insight into it all.  In one of them she encourages us to not dwell on 'it' the relationship and 'him' the abuser and focus on us.  Not easy but interesting.

Another thing i started doing was keeping a Vlog on Youtube, dont know if you have a webcam and have considered that or not but ive gotten a lot of positive feedback and response to it so it may be something to consider also, thats a form of journaling also and may help, because i know i get tired of writing/typing sometimes and thats a great alternative.
112658	464508	464508	reply_to_discussion	Cassie Ellen	1376540337	Journaling and cycling are my favorite outlets. Writing helps me to get in touch with my feelings even when I have no idea what they are until they appear on the page. I like to get out on my bike when I can, though more often it is an exercise bike in the gym. I let the negative stuff drive my movement into exhaustion. Insomnia being a big problem for me, that helps quite a bit.

They helped me a lot and my friends noticed a change in me as well when I was making them. It just helped for me to kind of get everything off my mind and into a video. I haven't made one of them in about 2 months or so, and I am getting ready to start making them once again. Due to the fact that I have noticed the change in myself since I haven't been talking (even to myself) about what I've been upset or down about."

117285	481080	481080	reply_to_discussion	CKarma	1380047111	I think it possible to cheat for a host of reasons, what doesn't change though is the hurt it causes.  If you love your partner, show him how you have changed and make a huge effort to in fact change, if this is something you can do on your own with support and self introspection, great!  If not, seek counseling, identify what led you to stray in the first place and what kept you going back for more.  This is one of those times in life where you need to take a good look in the mirror and find out who you are and whether you are happy with who is looking back.
117285	482294	482294	reply_to_discussion	J-Low	1380247866	Thank you, CK.  I've checked back here every day since I've posted my discussion.  You're the only person who's responded and I appreciate it more than you know.  The hurt that I feel right now due to the consequences of my actions is so emotionally distressing and so isolating, it's hard for me to carry through with my day to day.  I'm not looking for sympathy from anyone.  I have no misguided belief that I deserve any pity, I guess I'm just looking for some form of solidarity amongst those that share the pain I feel.  I know full well what a cad I am and what scum I've aligned myself with, but this does not define me.  21 of the 23 years I've spent in this relationship as a faithful, supportive and loving partner where I spent so much time as the sole breadwinner, the caretaker, and the caregiver, have to count for something.
117285			start_discussion	J-Low	1380247866	My story may be no different than others I've combed through this morning.   For two years, I was cheating on my partner of 20+ years and he recently found out back in July.  The devastation to our lives has been unimaginable.  I underestimated the consequences and never expected how many lives would be touched and how deeply these acts would damage not only my partners soul, but mine as well. We're trying very hard to work through it and rebuild our relationship (which I frankly don't feel like I deserve), but he's moved out temporarily.  We still make it a point to spend time together once, if not twice a day to avoid drifting apart.

142657	600910	600910	reply_to_discussion	heartbrokenmom	1393478118	My husband and I went through something like this as well, we were married for 13 years at the time, he too lied and lied about still talking to her ect. We did get through it, it was not easy but its been 2 years or so now since it happened and it still crosses my mind from time to time but he doesn't talk to her period because if he did all hell would brake loose, I am sorry but your husband still having contact with her is not ok, very disrespectful in my opinion. One of my biggest regrets throughout all of it is that I allowed myself to be treated that way, I am very disappointed in myself because I know that I am better then that, I deserve better then that, I feel a little stupid for chasing after him like I did, I should have told him that he could have the tramp but when your in so much pain, so hurt by the one you never expected would hurt you, your not thinking straight. Time does heal pain and you will begin to get over it, it does get easier except if he is still communicating with this woman, I don't see anything getting better in tell he stops. Don't ever let anyone make you feel like you deserve this kind of treatment cause nobody does but as long as you keep allowing it he will continue doing it
142657	600910	600926	reply_to_comment	Kiwi	1393479935	@heartbrokenmom very well put great advice.

He has to end this. But it is tricky getting him to the point of realizing this. I found that the more I complained, the more I made drama over the trashy person he chose over me, the more he dug his heels in and was resistive to make the changes he needed to make  to break it off. So you feel like you are a mess cause he is a mess. He has to realize this is driving a GIANT wedge between you. You will not be a doormat. You are too wonderful to be disrespected. Please realize your strength and power. He chose you, not her. You will prevail. I know you will!! I know exactly what you are going through, unfortunately.  I have the same insecurities. BUT YOU ARE HIS LOVE OF HIS LIFE.  Realize that most of these affairs start not out of love. He loves you!  So make your love together grow in ways that will surprise him. But first be your own best friend. You are in a vulnerable place because of the bad choices he has made. So give yourself room to breathe, have fun, allow yourself to become obsessed with spoiling yourself. Make each day a gift to yourself. You deserve to have fun. He will see that you are becoming a person that is self assured and in control of her destiny. Is he the man you have wanted? Let him know in subtle ways that because he is doing this, he is really not that hot after all. He needs to feel a little insecurity after you. Being a little bit adventurous might be out of your comfort zone right now cause he has left you feeling a little insecure about yourself. So you have to get that foxy lady back. Do it for you. Get in touch with your feminine side. She is a loser who cannot get a man of her own so she steals yours. That is the attitude that I mean. But saying that is not going to get the results you want. You must be way more subtle and show him you are the woman of his dreams. But you do not need this kind of rejection from anyone you gave your heart to. Your heart is way too precious to be broken and tossed around like an old pillow. Your heart and your wonderful self is precious beyond words. Have every opportunity to take good care of yourself. Rest as much as you can, but get up and exercise, get fresh air. Eat healthy. Do something wonderful for yourself. Is there a hobby you have been wanting to try? Take a self defense class or start doing art or whatever you enjoy. Do not obsess over him. Cheaters will find a way to cheat if they really want to. You have no control over them. So make your relationship so good that the loser of a mistress becomes superfluous!!! You will win here. She will not. His actions so far have shown that he loves you. So you are making progress already. Soon you will be saying, ""look how far we have come!!"" Be confident. You are the same person he fell in love with. You have not changed. This is his problem. You have the advantage cause no one wants to fail their marriage. He will have to make these changes or he will loose you. He will have to reassure you. Or the more he neglects this important step in healing your marriage, the more damage he will make and have to mend. It is a bit difficult to mend a broken heart. He is wasting time here. Not smart of him. Be tested for STDs @ your local health clinic, free and treatment is free. Anonymously if you prefer. Do not rely on him to do this. He can be a carrier and not show any symptoms. Try to avoid contact with this person who has come between you and he. Also avoid seeking information or details about the affair. It will only haunt you. Post on here as often as you like. Take one day at a time. ((Hugs)) God's peace."

It's true that it's not a small nose, but I've realized that it does fit well with my face (if that makes sense) and I actually like it now.  I feel like it's easy to focus on one specific supposed 'imperfection' but it's important to take a step back from that focus and look at the whole picture-and how it all fits together in who you are.

Nothing wrong with being gay, but sounds like you're just  going through a questioning phase. It happens.  But it doesn't mean anything, and is completely natural!

149833			start_discussion	patriotslover1991	1396051761	I've always obsessed over things, illnesses my weight, my body image. My mind has always been my biggest enemy. Not many people know that about me. I'm an athlete, come from a great family and everything. One night I was smoking some weed with my buddies and I was just sitting there and it felt my mind patched together a bunch of random memories and just told me that I was gay this whole time unknowingly. Now I've never been attracted to a guy, never had feelings for one either. I mean I have a few close friends that I love and would do anything for but that's normal. I've never touched another guy in any way and kind of always been weirded and grossed out by anything gay. (No offense!!) But that's just not me. I had a girlfriend for over 4 years, I've hooked up with numerous other girls and have had crushes on some girls as well.  Now as a little kid you have to find yourself and experiment to find out for yourself so I do remember looking at gay stuff when I was little just to see what it was, and obviously I didn't enjoy it. I just don't know how to get these thoughts out of my head, the thoughts patch together me being on the wrestling team, liking wwf and wwe stuff. I don't want these thoughts but now everytime I see a guy I'm over analyzing them. The only time I actually look at guys is at the gym to just see their physique but that's a normal competitive nature I feel we all possess. I do not want these thoughts but my mind is telling me I do want these and I'm hiding from my own reality. I find it so stupid because I know how my mind is and I feel like I can obsess over everything, and as soon as I start too I look stuff up on the internet and read. Any help? Thanks!

There is a part of me that I think wants to recreate a relationship of supportive but unhealthy dependency like what I had with my mother, and I have to be careful not to try to build up that kind of unhealthy dependency with anyone here, for my sake and theirs.

I am very prone to addictions, but I really think I have squelched my need and my desire.  I focus more on the right thing.  and focus on what I aspire to be.  not what I desire to want.  I was watching Game of Thrones.  and Jaimie Lannister was talking to Lord Varys.  Lord Varys (The Spider) always has his informants but it is a eunuch.  He confessed to Jaimie Lannister that even though I don't miss the desire to be with a man or woman.  I have found that there is so much that be accomplished in a lifetime if you don'y spend time chasing your DESIRES.  I am reaching that point in my life and it is kind of scaring me as to what I might become.

Would the goose be dumb enough to call the egg by the wrong name?  i.e. would the goose be dumber or smarter than the chick.  Does that help?

Every feather has it's time. But the time we have stuck to the chicken is time together. Hopefully we don't get plucked all together because that means cooked duck for dinner.

Like I said before at some point, this is no different from shingles. It gets into nerve roots and pops out every once in a while. No one judges shingles though, we all sympathize with people who get it. Its all because H is sexually transmitted. We feel guilty and dirty. Why though? Sex is natural, it's not like we committed a crime. Many of us got it from people who didn't know they had it, or they didn't tell us. It's not going to kill us. every once in a while we may get outbreaks, but that is all there is to it. Cheer up everyone! There are way worse issues in this world.

There are other ways if you do not want to have unprotected sex. The chances of him receiving the virus from you is 4% while having unprotected sex. Educate yourself so you can better educate him.

237250	1084003	1085601	reply_to_comment	MagDLynn	1423608331	@justme1896 martial arts would build muscle, which increases weight gain. Maybe you could ask to take a self defense class? That might be allowable.

Since I've taken these classes for the past couple months, I've gained weight. I can't tell by the eye really because it's an increase in muscle mass. However. before the classes, I'd lose weight  randomly from stress, not eating enough, running. These classes has helped me build muscle. I'm not liking the numbers, but oh well, lol. I was in the one-teens, but now I'm 120. It's also helps mentally. The classes are difficult, but knowing that I am able to push myself to reach where I want to be gives me hope that everything is going to be just fine. But, I do love it! It's great :-) And don't forget protein. I eat at least 2 brown hard boiled eggs a day; great source of lysine too!

I look forward to those specific days so I can use it!! I too was prescribed antidepressants and Xanax and then I became this ""puddle of mud"" that was bawling in the corner somewhere!! serious panic attacks...the whole nine yards...I think I even came up with an extra symptom or two that is just fro me!! I began researching the specific vitamins that help menopausal symptoms...500mg of magnesium before bed will really help you!  I use fish and gflax seed oil 3000mg each every day. Vitamin D3 for mood as well...2500IU a day...Vitamin E  1000mg a day, Vitamin C 1000mg 3x a day...Super Biotin for thinning hair skin and nails, Super B complex for energy! AND I WALK!! The treadmill (besides the cream) is the best tool in my arsenal!   It is NOT your imagination...the cream works! I buy mine from Amazon.com and SOURCE NATURALS is the brand name...4oz jar for around $15!!! Try it out...best deal out there! One jar lasts me a little more than 2 months. I use it as face cream as well, helps those little fine laugh lines! You might look into the book ""What your DR may not tell you about menopause"" This is where I got all my info from and has become my new bible. I have been on this program since November 2013 and THANK GOD I found this info! I have not had a single serious mood swing or panic attack since beginning this program of cream and supplements. SOOO glad you found a DR who knows about this and is helping ladies thru this without handing out cancer causing HRT (ESTROGEN!) look up this book, it will all make perfect sense to you! This cream can also PREVENT endometrial and breast cancer and OSTEOPOROSIS! Hope this helps you know it isn't just you...I KNOW!!  So glad you found our group and WELCOME!

Does the anxiety come back when you stop the cream?  I am so afraid mine will when I stop on the 28th day of my cycle.  Md said with the bioidenticals it could take me 2-3 months to level out.

Mass frustration, hot flashes that turn your ears red! Unpredictable cycles that would come and go and either be so horrendous and last for 4 days, then the next one would be just light enough to ruin your pants and last foe WEEKS! The cream has regulated those cycles...right on time now! All about the same. The most amazing thing has happened though...I had a fibroid in my breast for more than 10yrs. After I had been  using the cream for about 3 months, I noticed that it wasn't hurting before my cycle began like it normally has...no stinging, no snapping feeling that had been there for every cycle for 5 yrs. I did a self exam and it had VANISHED! I couldn't believe it!   Pure unbelievable! The anxiety does come back if you don't exercise, and I know some say well, I walk a lot at work, or I am active..NOT THE SAME as walking and getting your heartrate up  and just walking.  The supplements will help greatly ...AND DRINK WATER!!! 80oz min a day. I use Metamucil 2x a day to help digest the supplements or they can cause constipation.  UGH! Nobody needs that!   I am so glad you have found this information!  My poor husband was finding me in the back of my closet crying over (God only knows...kitty litter commercial?) lol EVERYTHING!!  Im thought I was losing my  mind!  Forgetful, cant concentrtate, HOT!!! There are 34 of these wonderful symptoms!!  Do you have any others besides the anxiety that have been very hard to deal with?

That is one of the biggest mistakes is ppl take too much thinking more is better..not so...start off with 1mg and cut in half... if you have trouble falling asleep, take it a couple of hrs before bed, trouble STAYING asleep, take it at bedtime...if the 1/2 mg doesn't help after a week, l up the dosage to the full 1mg...hope this helps...headed to work myself... maybe we will see each other tonite!

266748			start_discussion	BiancaTolley94	1430409775	Okay so I thought i'd share my story with you.. around 3 weeks ago I started getting reaaaally itchy down there, no discharge or any strange smells, just really bloody itchy! This carried on for about a week and then I noticed a blister. I thought it was because I had been scratching the same spot all the time. I also had swollen glands in my groin. I went to the gum clinic and I was told that it wasn't herpes and it would clear up in a day or two.. Hours later there were about 10 ulcers. I couldn't walk, go to the toilet, wash, sleep, sit down, nothing. I called NHS 111 helpline and they booked me in immediately at the primary care centre at my local hospital. The GP checked me out and said he needed to treat me for herpes. At this point it smells foul, theres around 20 ulcers and im in excruciating pain. My partner was completely understanding about the whole thing, weve been in a faithful relationship for around a year and a half now. When I found out what it was I cried and cried and cried for days, simply because I thought I was going to lose him. I couldn't eat, I was that stressed. So anyway I started my treatment of acyclovir, 400mg 3 times a day for 7 days. At first the ulcers continued to get worse and worse. By 21/04/15 I was getting better. Still a bit sore but I could see they were all healing nicely and new skin was forming. Right now my sores have all healed, there is no longer a foul smell and I feel brilliant.

Normally if you herniated discs your treatment can range from physical therapy to surgical procedures like a discectomy/Laminectomy or a fusion. Make sure anyone you go to is reputable.

I think one definitely does learn a great deal about how the human mind is capable of dealing with such adversity.  One big challenge is having to reinvent who I am as a human being.  Like you, I was always very active in athletics, etc., and now I am much more limited, though I can still exercise.  So in a sense, I lose a large part of my identity, and have to redefine who I am as a person.  Which discs did you herniate?

286403			start_discussion	NikkiGnarley	1435805086	Hello all. I am a newbie and desperate for support. Last July I fell at work and herniated 3 discs. I used to be very active, hiking, camping, sports, basically anything involving movement and the sunshine! Since my accident, my life has come to a grinding halt. I have always dealt with depression but these last few months have been nearly unbearable. Since I fell at work, the BWC is controlling everything about my treatment, or there lack of. It has been 7 months since my last physical therapy session because the BWC continues to deny my claims. My husband has been an amazing supporter throughout all of this, but I can't lay all this on his shoulders anymore. I used to be a social butterfly, but you realize who your friends are when you end up in a wheelchair and can't travel. I guess all I'm looking for in this support group is just to hear that someone else is going through the same thing that I am.

294015	1375781	1375781	reply_to_discussion	Angeltears	1437598647	I think sometimes what happens is that a caring nurturing person who is sensitive to the needs of others gets pushed aside in a world where me-ism is considered something to be admired.  You know like nice guys finish last thing.  Others around you    may be selfish and because you may genuinely care for others again in a culture where others only seemingly care when its to their own benefit.  It seems it may not occur to them that you are a person with needs of your own.  Oftentimes this can also be viewed as weak.  When in fact it is not.  Others around you are fine because adversity has not yet hit them in the rear.  Sadly a lot of folks have learned to live a life of pretense and self worth comes from status, money etc. while everyone talks about character I do not believe most especially young people really know what that actually is.  How sad. But there is comfort in knowing, no you are not alone.  Blessed are the meek in heart.

It is good to find the middle ground its not good to live selfishly or just for others, everything is good in moderation...and us kind and sensitive people need to find a place to first love and care for ourselves then help others when we feel it is appropriate... but law of this world is to care first for yourself

Also, school causes me so much stress, which will probably make me eat more and that will make me gain more weight and feel worse about myself. Apart from that, there are other things wich are making me feel constantly down. Today has been a bad day, and I'm sorry for ranting.

The problem is nobody wants to mention anything about his health and I feel left in the dark about it but if I bring it up I'm sure we'll both be emotional wrecks and that's not the most comfortable state for us. I'm not sure how to start up a close relationship like I want when we haven't had it all these years.
336678			start_discussion	Lifetimestudent07	1448683760	Hey...my first post I'm just looking for some kind of support I guess. My dad is not doing well and I'm really not handling it well at all. He's had a severe downward spiral this past year that included multiple deaths in his immediate family, several strokes and aneurisms, losing his job, and now liver and kidney failure. He's just over 50. My parents are divorced and we always spent more time with my mom so even though I love my dad more than anything, we don't usually talk up front about this. In fact, I pretty much only find out about what's going on with him when I ask or when he's been in the hospital for a few days. I find myself withdrawing from him because it makes me so sad to think of him like that but I also don't want to have him suddenly pass away and not have spent all that time with him. I'm just not sure how I will be able to deal with it when he does pass away. I'm terrified.

Secondly herpes is not something that you need to die for it is a virus and if it turns out that you do have it you can manage it and you can still live a normal life. People have relationships and children.  What you have to understand is that herpes is based on your immune system which means that if you are currently not eating or sleeping you will not recover if you are having an outbreak quickly.  So get out of bed and try and do things to keep your mind occupied because the reality is it is just a virus and there is nothing to stop you from getting on with your day to day activities unless you are having a really bad outbreak at the moment.

He is not  that bad though, but I do worry how he is going to treat women in relationships.He's not girl crazy, and is a smart kid so when he does start dating , I am going to impart more real life influence for the sake of his own happiness as well as the women he relates with.  My daughter is not at all like her father and yet kind of like me, she does not always speak up for her rights or lets her brother or friends get away with bossing her around.   It is hard when you and a husband are not team players, and helping out one another and my husband tends to be like a ""big kid"" sometimes, where he puts his wants and desires first, or pits the kids against one another or criticizes or ignores my point of view , or parenting right in front of the kids.

This is very interesting and eye-opening as an option for those of us who experience neck and back pain. It's a posture alignment and structural integration to help alleviate pain. How did you hear of this, did your doctor recommend this? Thank you so much for bringing it to our attention. I am always looking for new methods of pain alleviation, most especially since I have neck and upper back pain.
45401	96669	96669	reply_to_discussion	Princess	1301678719	I was actually looking into getting a massage and then as I was looking Egoscue and Rolfing popped up in my search. I am 24 and I have lots of neck/back problems and I am looking for things that are available to me to help with my back and neck problems cuz I have had problems for at least 10 yrs now and it's gotten worse, and more frequent and I want to do anything I possibly can so it don't even get worse then it already is. Also I am not sure why I have such problems I was never really ever in a accident but I just wake up and it is just so sore. I am glad that I could give other people a resource to use that suffer through back and neck pain as well. Thanks for your post. I will let you know if I do go through with Rolfing or Egoscue and how it went and how it helped me. From what I read online I think it's suppose to be very helpful and you can really benefit from it.
45401	96751	96751	reply_to_discussion	puppydoglvr	1301693447	Princess, I am so sorry that you are feeling neck and back pain. I absolutely agree with you in that you should nip it in the bud and start caring for it before it gets worse. I waited until it was really bad before I got treatment. My friend, who has a health and wellness studio and also teaches pilates, turned me on to a doctor who specializes in the Atlas. I saw him and referred a close friend of mine and it changed both of our lives. The pain I felt, the dizziness, the arm, hand, and foot numbness, I thought that it was going to be for the rest of my life. Here is a link to the site which can give you some information; http://www.atlasorthogonality.com/. I was shocked to learn how much the Atlas effects the rest of your spine and what was going on with my spine on the whole.

I have back and neck pain and Egoscue and Rolfing helps with back pain and neck pain and so I am wanted to ask if anyone have heard of or have had Egoscue and Rolfing? If you have heard of Egoscue and Rolfing what have you heard about it. Or if you have had Egoscue or Rolfing, did it help you?

What your uncle did is simply a terrible abuse of your and your parents' trust. Let me give you a big hug and tell you you are not alone! Also I wonder if you still have to see your uncle? Is there any way you could tell your parents about what happened so that they can keep you safe? Maybe your uncle can't go after you again with one foot less (yes, indeed thank God for karma!) but I'm really worried about you having to interact with this man. You should come first and I know it is impossible to begin healing from sexual abuse when the perpetrator is still around. Hope to hear from you again, best wishes!!
68014			start_discussion	K_Marlana	1330293264	When I was younger (8-9), I was molested by my uncle. He would tell my parents that he was going to take me to a movie of go fishing. Instead, we sat by the lake while he kissed me and put his hand in my underwear or come in while I was in the shower and undress. He would threaten me so I wouldn't tell. He made me touch his body and I felt like I was going to be sick everytime. I would hide but he always found me. I never did tell my parents. I am 17 now and it still haunts me. He developed diabetes and had to have a foot amputated. Thank God for Karma

Also, there are medical holistic treatments, but you have to have a medical guidance,because each person reacts differently to the medicine. You have children, they need you, health is very important, take care of yourself. God bless you.

81686	314819	314819	reply_to_discussion	2InsomniasAtl	1349414009	"I totally agree with you all. Work used to be (and still is) my motivator. Everything revolved around it. It gave me a reason to get up every morning because I knew without it I wouldn't be able to pay bills and enjoy the hobbies I liked such as traveling and trying new restaurants. I really tried to concentrate on my hobbies and put them at the forefront after I lost my job but it wasn't the same. I couldn't travel anymore because that would cost way too much money and eating out at new restaurants made me feel guilty. I kept thinking, ""How could I enjoy this meal when I should be saving the money for a bill."" Not to mention my sleep schedule has been out of wack also...I guess this is normal when you're unemployed. I can't say I miss the job but I miss working...Before I lost it, I didn't know how much it would affect me. All I can say is hang on to the possiblity of getting back in the ring. That's what keeps me going. I know it's hard but I'll find work again...I have to...the economy can't stay like this forever...right?"
81686			start_discussion	kinetic	1349414009	I hate this!!! I truly hate this! I can't get started on anything, I can't even imagine the future.  I need it all: new friends, new job, new town and I see none of it yet.  What do you do when all you want after you wake up is the go back to sleep and hope the world is not judging and deriding you for it.  What do you do when you don't care. I want sleep, I need sleep--- Sleep is my only friend and we are Thelma and Louise right now.   I need a job, I need to re-establish connections but it is difficult for me to see this as remotely realistic.  How does one envision a future?  Do I need to see a future to move forward- visual exercises?  How Do I get out of bed? With Shame--nevers works, With comtemplation- better but no guarantee, With Patience-- see shame.

However, you are important. You deserve true happiness. We all do. If you're like me, you're probably use to the abuse..and find it hard to be alone. I can't say it gets any easier. But it sounds like your little sisters care and if you leave you'll really benefit from their support. Sometimes the damage of emotional abuse can be worse than physical abuse. Try self help books.

93516	375970	375970	reply_to_discussion	starvega14	1363731959	Well after reading her post i just could not believe my eyes because it's pretty much the same situation that I am in. I was in denial for alomg time bt i am not no more! I moved in this house from Tennessee to Alabama and i have been here for over three years now and I found out he lies like crazy and he's not a very compassionate man like he seemed when we met and everything he does seems like he has a motive to it, well not seems, he does! I have alot of medical conditions, I have a seizure disorder and an anxiety disorder which was not as bad till he drove me crazy with all his lies and I had moved in with him way to fast i think and he wanted me to but i said to him do you think we should wait a year at least? he said oh no I love you and I don't want us to drive back and forth to see each other, lol. So I moved in. Now after that I never saved any money and he is a spending freak and had to many loans out. i never knew all this stuff. So now i have finally come to terms with that I have to move on and he's not happy and that's because i won't be here to bail him out when he runs out of money to spend. So I know for sure that man does not love me, he wanted me here out of convenience. Pretty sad. i will be gone by May. But i'm happy your husband and you are going to try and work things out. Best of wishes.
