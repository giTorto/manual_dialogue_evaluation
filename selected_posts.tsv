401	100828			start_discussion	Sheila4health	1367297314	Hello Everyone - I'm just starting out in this group. I was diagnosed as pre-diabetic on March 1st. I am finding that is seems to be taking over my life, planning meals and doing research on diabetes. I don't really have anyone to talk to about this and so hope to find some support here, as well as supporting all of you. My Dad had type 1 diabetes and died at age 59 due to complications...I don't want that to happen to me...so I feel like I need to get on the right track with a good food plan. I am presently counting carbs, but still my blood sugar seems to go up and down quite a bit. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks.	0

I know this might mean you are told to leave, so make plans, if you weren't planning on attending school or planning on going to school and living at home, then things need to change.  This is totally unfair, but it is better to be safe and poor than to be financially taken care of and scared for your safety.	0

He immediately sent me a text like ""now I get why you're always locked in your room with that girl"". I ignored it. Once she left, he began banging on my door screaming and saying the meanest things and threats. My room is in a seperate little in-law set-up. So you have to open the main door to get into the house, but then there is a bedroom, bathroom that are connected and all have doors. Eventually I went into the office, behind another locked door, so I didn't have to hear him. I was quietly on the phone with my girlfriend crying and extremely terrified. Eventually he BROKE down the door. And was in the main area. I was freaking out. My girlfriend almost called the police because she was so scared he was going to hurt me. I'm 18, but there is no way I can leave my house at this point. I'm so scared of being home alone with him now and I can't even have my girlfriend over anymore. Does anyone have any experience with this or advise?"	0

I awaken once more to the dreadful reality of what has become of my life. My heart breaks, my soul screams out to them. I can almost hear their screams join mine, entwining once again, the sound, the beautiful symphony of our miracle. Pushing past the pain I smile, basking in the exquisite beauty of their song. I hum it softly to myself as I prepare to begin my day. A beautiful day. Today I shall walk to my favorite park, get some exercise, repair just a little bit more my broken body, heart, and soul. I shall sit by the lake reading yet another Nicholas Sparks novel. Yes, I, a man, truly love his work, how could I not. After I shall come home, make a nice meal, write more of the latest book I'm working on. I'll check in here, help if I'm able. As my day draws to a close I shall be smiling once again, proud, honored. I'll have survived another day, and lived well once more. As I lay my head down I shall whisper the same thing I have every single night since this happened to us, I Love You, and their names. Closing my eyes. drifting away into the before, the after, I shall cry. Not because I'm sad, but because I know once I'm asleep, my girls will be there, waiting for me, arms wide open, smiling, and proud. Another beautiful day, another sacred night."	0

When the xall went out that a deputys som had been injured in an armed robbery, all 2000 people working for them were on the lookout. They treated me good. They would stop in after they left work and see if i was okay. Because of my work achedule, and me not being able to miss even a single day, and the optuon of paid time off unavailable, i wasnt going to be able to meet with a victims advocate lawyer. The woman would leave work to go hone and go 45 minutes out of her way to help me and get my paperwork done. But before it went through, she was moved out of victims advocate. The lady who got my case fter her never botheres to call me and give me an update on the status. Because of that, my victims advocate exprired. Now im stuck paying the ems bills, and paying for any coubciling. But with my mom still working for the sheriffs office, ill get to see someone for free. Ita just hard to ask for help like that. Its even harder because i cant protect myself. I cant legally own a pistol, and i cant afford a shotgun...i dont know what to do to maie myself feel safe again. My paranoia keeps me inside after dark. I constantly hear things at night and panic...i cant even stand to be alone in any room anymore. I wake up in a cold sweat every night from nifhtmares now...this isnt how a 19yr old boy should live. Ive got a fiance and a 2yr old stepson to think of for Gods sake...how can i protect them if i couldnt even react fast enough to peotect myself? Its not like i dont know how to...i do.

Its 500 degrees, and searing to the touch...if i couldve just pushed him into it...just gotten the gun away...he threatened me and my step mom...i wanted him dead. I still do.

Depending on where he is on the spectrum there are a variety of therapies which can be really beneficial. The ""go to"" therapy is ABA (applied behavioral analysis).  It helps teach the child the cope better in the world, and has been proven to be quite effective.  There are other therapies which focus on relationship developments and even therapies which help with sensory issues.  Someone posted a youtube video on sensory type therapies, and I found it amazing.  The gist was ""how can we teach social skills when a child is being overwhelmed by sensory input""?  I would start looking toward an agency that specializes in Austim Spectrum.  Also, get on board with the school, often they do their own testing and stuff to assess and assign an EAP, counselors etc. Take one day at a time, it is overwhelming at first but the more information you soak in the more prepared, and confident you will be!

First of all, you want to know 100% to be sure, and to know whether you have both types or just one. Second, the primary outbreak is mild for some, but really nasty for others (as I know firsthand), and not countering it with meds or waiting too long can mean the difference between dealing with it for days vs. weeks. And last, having more info on your condition can help manage your stress level, which is hugely important.	0

Guys sometimes get random erections and girls over lubricate randomly at times, it doesn't mean we're aroused or anything. Sometimes as I've learned, the body does whatever the heck it wants. Soo I hope the above post helped some of you. Also on a more depressing note, your body is not the number one indicator that you are aroused. Sadly, rape victims can have orgasms while being raped but that doesn't mean they liked it or it was not rape. Sometimes our bodies do betray us.

It's not all about what your body feels. I mean a lot of people talk about how they watched porn and got a groinal response but felt disgusted and ashamed afterwards like obviously you wouldn't be thinking that if you were mentally aroused from it, right? Lots of woman can't orgasm but continue having sex with their partners because they love their partner and are more concerned with emotional and mental connection versus how many orgasms they can have. Same with men who also have bedroom problems I guess. Ocd just likes to take a simple matter and make it bigger.	0

I have had some pretty bad Health OCD for most of my life. I've worried about a lot of crazy stuff happening to me: having a heart attack, stroke, cancer, schizophrenia, going blind, deaf, throwing up, fainting, and so many other things you wouldn't believe. Having health OCD, I have put A LOT of emphasis and over analyzation into my body parts. If I feel one painful or ""uncomfortable"" sensation in ANY part of my body I immediately begin to over analyze it and begin to worry in what it could possibly mean for me which in turn brings anxiety and very bad panic attacks. For example: I am deathly afraid of vomiting. This fear has existed in me for a very long time and has caused me much suffering. Whenever I used to feel weird pains or sensations in my stomach immediately I would begin to cry and worry that this was some sign of nausea and I would be sick in seconds. BUT when I took my attention away from my stomach, told myself I wasn't sick, or just tried to calm down ""miraculously"" the pain would go away. The same thing counts for all body parts. When you begin to over analyze a body part obviously it will begin to feel weird or tingly or just uncomfortable. When you force yourself to watch porn of the orientation that you fear or have those thoughts or  whatever it is obviously a compulsion you are creating in order to ""test"" yourself and you believe in order to ""fail"" this ""test"" means that you have to feel something in your groin area. By doing this you are already causing anxiety in yourself, and WORSE you're thinking black and white. Maybe the groinal response is just because you're over focusing on that area? Anxiety and arousal cannot exist in the same moment. The chemicals cannot coexist together or be made at the same time."	0

Even though you two did the right thing and it was something you agreed on, giving up your baby still might be something he is taking hard. Perhaps he doesn't want to burden you with his sadness which is thoughtful but ultimately hurting you. When you have time alone in a quiet moment, ask him again about his feelings, and make it clear that you want to be with him through it and share your feelings together. This could go a long way towards getting back your old closeness. Best of luck and keep us posted!	0

I'm sorry that things are a bit confusing right now. Maybe some counseling can help you both to communicate your feelings. You have both been through a major event. Your fiancee may be going through a grieving process. Try to look after yourself. Exercise and try to eat. Do you have a group(s) or counselor for your other issues? You both are going to need some time to adjust and process your decision. I wish you the very best   :-)	0
461	192811	841887	841887	reply_to_discussion	lovemusic	1411003925	Hi My_Own, do you have a therapist/counsellor in your area you can go to for some help with everything you are currently facing? Try not to put blame on yourself and punish yourself for anything. Be kind and considerate towards yourself, you are doing your best and are facing a lot right now. Try considering some relaxation time for yourself, to alleviate some of the stress you are currently dealing with. Exercise, walks, meditation, reading a book, listening to calming music, journal writing, a creative outlet	0

But you both made a decision that was to benefit all of your lives in the correct way. Some people deal with stress differently. and sometimes it's harder for males to express to their loved ones what is going on with them, because they have been forced to cover up the bad feelings and 'man up' in the past. If you both are not undergoing therapy, together and separately, I would suggest that it is mentioned to him and asked to be taken very seriously, because you don't want your relationship to suffer in the mean time. Hang in there, and know that you have support here.	0
463	192811			start_discussion	My_Own	1411875799	Ever since we gave our baby up I feel like my fiance has been cold and distant towards me. He was more willing to give her up than I was, so I don't think he holds it against me... But I'm not sure what else it might be. I did put on a little weight but after my C section I couldn't get out of bed much for a while... I've relapsed back into not eating again and I have been self- harming again under the guise of being accident prone. He isn't as affectionate as he used to be and seems to spend as much time as he can at work or with his brothers, away from home and without me. I don't know what to do. I asked him about it and he says things have just been busy... I don't know...	0

I'm also 17 and have only been dealing with this for about a year but its a living hell. I was always into guys romantically and sexually, I used to fantasizes about the perfect boyfriend and who my future husband would be and stuff like that. Then the ocd hit and suddenly I'm questioning everything. Like you said in your post I too have always admired/been jealous of other girls however I never remember wanting a relationship with them. The worst part is my brain has made my past a weapon against me and just when I think I'm getting better it will bring something up and I'm terrified and confused again. It even got to a point where I did ""come out"" to myself but it didn't feel right. I felt numb, like I was acting, like I wasn't being me and the funny thing is when I did that   my brain immediately told me that I was most certainly not gay. That's when about when I found out about hocd. I had read/heard stories from actual gay people talking about when they knew and never really related to them, but when I started reading the stories of hocd sufferers I knew I found my problem because everything they said sounded like me just like your post. I've read that the only way to beat hocd is to just stop caring about, now I haven't completely mastered that myself, in fact I'm pretty far from the finish line, but I am fighting and that's really all you can do, just keep fighting. -snowbud :)"	0

479	199820	877046	877116	reply_to_comment	ryann123	1413168714	@snowbud Thank you and everyone else for all your support- its been a very rough journey for me. Especially since, the first time I had this, I just thought it was a really weird phase and didn't even know about HOCD. I'm just trying to live my life normally, because my heart knows that I've always loved guys and that I am so happy with my boyfriend. My thoughts are just trying to scare me, but I know that in the end, I've only felt that way about guys, and that's the only way I'll ever feel, because that's just how I was born. You're very right, I grew up always jealous of other girls, and I think my mind is mistaking that admiration and jealousy for attraction. My self esteem has always been on the lower side, especially because I never thought I was good enough for any guy to like me (even though I would have emotional attachments with them for months and months at a time). I also just happen to have a personality similar to those with OCD- always feeling responsible for things, also going to worst case scenario, perfectionism, overthinking the shit out of things... I think what HOCD is teaching me is that I have to stick with my first answer, my gut answer, what I've always been comfortable with, and that's being straight. I hope we all get through this together :) Think of it this way- when I'm not obsessing about this, I'm without a doubt straight, chasing after guys, thinking of girls as only friends. I have many many fears, and I'm hoping I'm on my way to getting rid of them	0

490	199820	877916	877916	reply_to_discussion	Jim322	1413223166	@JimmyG People can suppress many things, but I think sexuality isn't one. They can only choose NOT TO ACT on it.  All of gay folks knew they were gay since very young age/early puberty(12-13 years). And they all liked their thoughts and were afraid of how people will react on them. If I feel like throwing up when thinking of kissing guy, but ok and happy when thinking of kissing girl, I wouldn't call that denial, suppressed or anything like that.	0

You can't wake up one day and say ""hey, I just realized I'm gay"". That's not how it works. Especially if you liked girls whole your life. I remember, how day before this question kicked in, I met some girl on video chat. She was so beautiful and intelligent and had beautiful eyes. I was thinking ""this is kind of girl I would like to have for gf"". I even added her on facebook. Next morning, I think I'm gay. This doesn't make much sense, right?"	0

There's certainly a place to discuss the nuances of human sexuality, but this thread isn't it. HOCD is an anxiety disorder, not an identity disorder. Ryann123 is exhibiting telltale signs of HOCD and if we genuinely want to help her we shouldn't be trying to deconstruct what it means to be straight, gay, bi or any point on the theorized spectrum of sexuality, but rather be helping her deal with the anxiety disorder itself.	0

I've noticed that since my first hocd episode, my self esteem has decreased, my libido has shot down (I'll have baby relapses from 7th grade to now)...it's like my brain all of a sudden is asexual and I can't feel anything. It's literally like I can't feel anything. I think a lot of it comes from me being a tomboy when I was younger...idk anymore. It seems that I'll just be emotionless forever. My mind is telling me I want girls but I know that's such bullshit, yet the thoughts can't escape my mind I think this is what happens when you have severe untreated OCD of any kind, you end up feeling empty. I also have ROCD and other things associated with OCD so right now I just feel so empty and dead. I used to crush on all sort of guys, sure, I always wanted to be one of the guys as a tomboy, but never did I like girls like that, I just admired them a lot and wanted to always have friends that loved me. My life is just so OCD controlled that I don't even feel like a person anymore. A robot maybe. Deep in my heart, guys always had such a prominent role, I always wanted a boyfriend or a guy to like me back so badly, now I feel so empty and I just need help please help me	0

So basically, I'm a archetype case of HOCD and I have a boyfriend who my brain tells me I'm not even attracted to anymore.

I don't think there is truly getting a handle on it, I think it is more like grief.  We are grieving over the loss of fertility, the loss of a dream.  Grief never really goes away, it is always a part of who we are.

Have some water, try not to be so hard on yourself. Forgive yourself, see yourself as a little child that just needs some love, and give yourself some love and kindness.	0

Then I go to bed promising myself that tomorrow will be different, and  during the day it is, but the sun goes down and I get lost.	0

And like @beckyblue said be kind to yourself and love yourself. I have to spend some time, but not a lot, alone in the evening and I was having a hard time binging during that time. So I developed a plan that when I'm home alone that is me time. I take that time to do things for myself that I don't normally take the time to do. Be well!	0

I immediately noticed a change in my eating habits. It's best to keep really low calorie snacks around at night. Bags of mini pretzels, lots of liquids will help you feel fuller.  Try to get the feeling of fullness with a big plate of vegetables or low calorie soup. Don't beat yourself up.	0
530	227302	1028580	1028788	reply_to_comment	certifiedangus	1421085439	@autumn555 Hi autumn:  We all have physical strategies such as low calories snacks etc.  For me, the challenges is dealing with the food urges as I believe the urges are the real culprits.  To stop food urges, one has to mentally confront them.  My strategy is to emotionally detach from a food urge.  By successfully avoiding eating (even low calorie foods) I gain strength and weaken the habit  of binging when I have food urges and successfully deal with them.  I also believe a good aerobic workout can lessen the sting of my urges.	0

Except for the fact that my maternal grandmother, who was raising me at the time, was a nurse. And noticed. And didn't mention it to the doctor. Then again, there's so much blame on her for a whole lot of other problems that this one more just results in facepalm. At least my next guardian, my second cousin, noticed. She grouped it with other similar issues because she's not a nurse or doc, and tried to get me help for that ... she gets all the blame for me being able to be happy.	0

If you do end up going on the trip don't worry so much about the other kids life style you don't know for sure if all the kids are like that. You're focused on the negative you'll only see negative and miss that one good kid on the trip if you don't look for the positives	0

I've been in your position before and believe me, don't let yourself feel uncomfortable. You'll have plenty of other opportunities to be around people who are like you in the years to come. dont let it stress you.	0

552	261593			start_discussion	TheFoolishDreamer	1429204327	Sometimes I honestly believe that being sexually abuse is a fate worse than death. I was damaged badly because I wanted to be loved. So now 13 years later I am judged for the things I do so my mind can rest. I use to self-harm, drink, and smoke, anything so I could not think about the horrific childhood I had. Whatâ€™s very twisted and funny is that I was molested, gang raped, I was the true definition of abused and I am judged and my molesters werenâ€™t. They get to hide and be forgotten while Iâ€™m forced to try and live as normal of a life I can even though that ship had already left. The people who I have called â€œfriendsâ€� have never understood why I was weird. They told me I was depressing to talk to but it never dawned on them that maybe I was depressed and maybe I was reaching out to them for help.  It takes a special type of person to really understand what Iâ€™ve been through and more importantly who cares to HELP! I am lucky everyday despite my crying and mental break downs because I have an amazing non blood brother Joey. He has loved me more than I have loved myself and he saved me even when I was done. It takes pain and hurt to see who your real friends are.	0

He went with his older man rugby club for a week to Aussi and came back a changed man. But even before he never was seen with me anywhere. When we  would go out to the night market he would wonder off, never staying by my side. When we lived in CAN it was different he was always around me and going to the cafe's with me and to the gym and so forth. I miss the men I fell in love with! Anyways, he is not working right now and still staying all day in his room from 10 am to 2 am. Mind you he visited with his mate today, once a week. He won't tell me where his mate lives, get that. Then he has Facebook accounts in different names and of course I couldn't link mine to his, he knew how to stop it. He never takes me out anywhere but takes his mate out to eat and has taken his uncle out to eat. So what do you all think, is he cheating on me??	0

He wont even let the kids go out with their friends or if he does he punishes them when they get home.   Kids need friends.  I sometimes get jealous but they need those relationships and my kids have excellent friend groups so idk what his problem is.  When we go to church he is way worse.  It is like he must punish us for him feeling crappy about the things he has done in his life so he makes us feel bad because of it.	0

Like his affair (I forget the details) isn't even your biggest issue. I'm sorry you have to deal with all of that and have kids to consider. That sounds so hard. He should be trying to make you feel better and more secure in your life together. I have my worst days by myself, typically when he's there I'm better because I see him trying and I see the love he has for me. I couldn't stay if that wasn't the case. For instance. He's texting me now to tell me he's leaving work 10 min late so that I don't wonder what he's doing. It's been almost 3.5 months. I don't check up on him anymore but he's still considerate to make sure I'm not stressed.  I don't blame you for wanting to leave if hes not giving you any reason to stay. Sorry if that sounds mean. I meant it to sound supportive.	0

You are moving forward. You are taking baby steps but if that's what feels safest I think it's ok. As long as you're still moving in the right direction. you are a strong person.

She took care of almost everything besides most of the income and home repairs. She pretty much ran things. But I was forced with a decision step up and overcome. Or let the situation define me. I chose to overcome and I lived without her for months with my two daughters. Now she wants to reconcile. So one of the first thing I told her was she needs to be committed because even though I loved and cared for her I don't need her. My love for her is a choice. My point being you can do this. I was there. I was scared... really scared. Don't cut yourself short. Everyone is amazing and I would bet that you are also.	0

If you have already taken the role of the female in the relationship, then there may not be any need to change that. The most important thing is what you are already doing, and that is supporting him.  There may be some bumps as his anatomy changes, but going through the transition with him will allow you to get used to each step.  Just a thought, but you might want to consider therapy as a couple to discuss any concerns you may have during the transition. Alex4	0

I know, you've been so abused that it will take you a long time to stop feeling like you're walking on egg-shells.  It's okay!  Have you ever watched that old movie with Julia Roberts (it might have been named ""Sleeping with the Enemy""...I can't remember for sure right now) but that movie really, really hits home on how long it takes to feel safe after you've been through abuse.  You will reach a time when you can finally breath easier, and not have it come over you like it does now, it's just going to take time.  Thank God the police are so supportive and know to keep a watch on you, where you live, and if he comes anywhere near the house.  Just keep remembering he made his bed, you didn't do anything wrong, he's simply an abusive person and you were right there to be his convenient target.  I can't wait for the day to come for you when you are never afraid again.  It will happen, it's just a matter of time!"	0

I had a near death attempt that put me in the ICU for several days where they decided to take me off of all meds since it seemed to make things worse. I have been seeing a therapist for a couple of months and although it is helpful to have a place to talk, i am still struggling to cope with my past problems.	0

I was misdiagnosed as well for years my strange behaviour and irreg heart beat, then the lesions started showing up on the MRI's.  I cried myself to sleep many nights feeling hopeless, and alone.  My epilepsy made me socially awkward, and other things did not help like being the only kid in school from the childrens home, and such.  So i know about wanting, needing to be accepted into the clicks.  I let go of facebook for the same reeasons they are still harasing you.  So I can relate further into your situation.   Hold your head up.  You are better.  It is tough, but you are stronger.  You will find more strength in others to help you through your tough times.  I know it hurts when they talk behind your back, and how you feel when you see them talking you feel they are talking about you.  Please keep going.  It is worth it.  There are so many willing to help you light your path.  I hope the best for you.	0

I want you to know from a daughters point of view that the love and support of a mom is like no other. Sometimes as young adults and teenagers get so caught up in the busy world that we forget to see the big picture. We forget to notice the positive things in our lives because we let the negative things outshine them. I hope your daughter is doing well and again I appreciate all of the support. its funny how a few words given to someone can be so meaningful. Talk to you soon. Butterfly	0

680	47261	108286	108286	reply_to_discussion	Jassy	1305191682	Butterfly-I can somewhat relate.  I went from having no friends in highschool to going crazy the first few years in college just to fit in and make up for highschool.  I ended up losing friends and prostituting myself for alcohol.  I can't remember 2 years of my life due to alcohol.  I had a year long relationship with an amazing guy that I can't even remember being with him.  I can't tell you the number of times I attempted suicide.  I don't like to think of those day but I don't regret them.  I took the lessons from them and made myself a stronger person.  I have stopped drinking so much, I limit myself to only 3 times per month and usually don't even reach that quota.  I took some time to myself in order to love myself.  I have hit some bumps in the road recently but for the most part I am doing alright. You sound like an amazing person and probably are.  Suicide wont solve your problems, just create more for the people you love and who love you.  Life can turn around and I believe you are strong enough for it.  You have sought help which is more than most people.  Try some of the things that Sasha said.  I found music and volunteering with animals helps me get through my low points.  It is okay to have only a few close friends.  I have never had a million friends, right now I only have 3 really close ones.   You are not alone and even though we are strangers, I care about you and everyone here does.  Smile-you're alive.	0

I look forward to reading my post to see the positive and reassuring words. I went to therapy today and it was crazy to take a step back and see how far i have come in the past few month since my attempt. It feels good to focus on the positive aspects of my life. The hardest part is to acknowledge the negative/low points of my life without dwelling on them. I can't avoid the negative but i must move forward from it. It is so much easier said than done. The good news is that today I have felt positive and hopeful about my life (even with the rainy gloomy weather outside today) Sasha Thanks for the advice about journalling and reading.... ive started a journal and it feels so good. Jazzy I appreciate you sharing your story with me and i would love to be your facebook friend!

I have since passed it on to many many friends who will tell you it is the best thing ever: either to get through a rough patch or as a long term tool. Train your brain to think 'in balance' For each dark thought, there must be a bright thought Put a dark and bright spot on your hand for 3 months (That is about the time it takes to get the brain to 100% automatically think this way) So for 3 month the spots on your hand will serve to remind you how to think. Dark spot: OMG I cannot go on living with these headaches Bright spot: But my shoes are nice (or the sun shines or I love my sprouce's smil) It does not matter what you say to your self for the bright spot, as long as it is positive. Keep doing it and your brain will actually do it by it self later. Every 5 years or do so another 3 months, just to make sure you stay positive. I swear you can go through hell and still stay pretty positive with these spots.	0

783	50299	421235	422555	reply_to_comment	CatamountClyde	1370331145	Hi, everyone. I'm a newbie here, (with AvPD), saw the topic and decided to join the group because.... I just saw this movie tonight that made a huge impression, called Kymatica. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14Bn3uYqaXA Some of the conclusions and examples are faulty, but the overlying premises ring exactly true. The implications for the AvPD, or any personality disorder, are immense. Esp. toward the end where it mentions that genes do not control what we do and think, genes respond to what they experience. How do I change my outer self in order to make my inner self grow and evolve? The part about we are designed to either grow or respond to threat, and that we are being manipulated to respond to threat all the time, was also very useful, and I believe, true. Again lots of implications for PD sufferers. The video leads me to ask, how do I turn off my response to real or perceived threats (and oh, do I ever have a lot of AvPD induced perceived threats)? And, which behaviors, if any, will help me change my DNA back to full health? Thanks for letting me ramble.	0

Anyways, I've had type one diabetes for a little over a year and have lately been having some difficulties with it. My biggest problem right now is that almost everytime I talk about diabetes I get so overwhelmed that I just start crying. I'm not really upset about it, I just have a lot of stress/anxiety about it that builds up. I was wondering if any diabetics type one, type two, or type three (a term used to describe someone who knows someone/loves someone with diabetes) had any advice on how to not get so overwhelmed by it. I mean while I thought a year would be enough for it to settle in, one year out of 16 isn't a whole long time. I know diabetes isn't the worst thing to happen to someone but i'd appreciate a little insight if anyone has any-thanks!	0

I'm so proud of you for standing up for yourself even though its hard cause you need the extra pair of hands to help you out. But this will definitely force him to grow up and think about whether or not he wants to be responsible and treat you with respect. Having a child does require a lifestyle change. And it's not just for the mom but for the dad as well. You are being a responsible mom, he needs to do the same or step out of the way.  Wow, I wish you the best of luck in your situation and find a support group of new moms that know what your going thru. Yup, it's play date time lol.	0

If you don't stand up for your self he will just walk all over  you. and unfortunately some times you gotta lose something to realize how much it means to you. Maybe this break will make him see that he needs you and your son in his life. and maybe it will make him realize he isn't ready to step up and even as hard as that will be for you, it will make you stronger in the end and you will know what you want from a man bc you allowed nothing less from yourself.

Everything you do in a relationship , this one and/or future ones , will show you lil man how he should be treated AND how to treat a partner. My grandfather used to say "" a man shows his children how to love a woman, a mother shows her children what a woman deserves"" . So if you put up with crap, it's ok I treat and be treated like crap.

819	93884	363360	363360	reply_to_discussion	dream882	1361645810	I feel the same way somtimes. I feel like I just can't move or get out of bed, but I want to. It's weird but I force myself. I started going to church. It helped a little. I am going again tomorrow with a friend. I just escaped from an abusive relationship and I am kinda scared to go out. I just tell myself it will be okay and I pray and I joined this community! Just keep coming here and write down your thoughts, vent, make a list of goals and try to not let the negative feelings weigh you down! I feel as though I have a lot of trauma and due to that, I feel like I have too many things to get over. It hurts and I feel alone even though I have my family and my friends. I know I am not alone but still feel that way. I guess it is because I was so used to being in that relationship. It was unhealthy though so I had to get out!	0

Thank you for your support.  I don't have any support from family or friends. I isolate so much I haven't been able to maintain friendships.	0

It is funny how we all isolate and pushed away from people in our lives, yet we have joined a group so we can find support and understanding.  It seems to be contradictory.  But it is not.  We want people who will hear us, validate us, and yet, deep down, we don't want to remain stuck in this fighting and flighting life.  In this group, we find others who will tell us we are not crazy, gently nudge us to grow beyond the pain, and yet not condemn us on the days we recoil.	0

Take time out get stronger and take some more steps forward!!  I believe we all freeze and get stuck at times, but we cannot give up and let the trauma win - we have to live and enjoy life on our terms, by our rules, according to what we can or what we do not want to do, not anyone elses expectations.	0

825	93884			start_discussion	Destiny1105	1361933173	I'm frozen, stuck, I just can't seem to do anything. The only thing I've been doing is coming here.  I really want to work on my unresolved trauma but I'm frozen.  I just can't seem to move. I hate this feeling and am soo tired of this - its really getting me down.	0
